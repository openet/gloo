# (mandatory)
# Path to coverprofile file (output of `go test -coverprofile` command)
profile: _output/cover.out

# Holds coverage thresholds percentages, values should be in range [0-100]
# We should strive to increase these percentages over time
threshold:
  # (optional; default 0)
  # The minimum coverage that each file should have
  file: 50

  # (optional; default 0)
  # The minimum coverage that each package should have
  package: 50

  # (optional; default 0)
  # The minimum total coverage project should have
  total: 50

# Holds regexp rules which will override thresholds for matched files or packages
# using their paths.
#
# First rule from this list that matches file or package is going to apply
# new threshold to it. If project has multiple rules that match same path,
# override rules should be listed in order from specific to more general rules.
override:
  # Calls to external library, which is tested
  - threshold: 0
    path: ^projects/gateway2/generate.go
  # The only code at the top-level of the `projects/gateway2` package is code generation
  - threshold: 0
    path: ^projects/gateway2$

# Holds regexp rules which will exclude matched files or packages
# from coverage statistics
exclude:
  # Exclude files or packages matching their paths
  paths:
    # Exclude the protobuf generated files (pb.go, pb.equal.go, pb.hash.go)
    - \.pb\.go$
    - \.pb\.hash\.go$
