description: Using HashiCorp Vault as a backing store for Gloo Gateway secrets
---

Use [HashiCorp Vault Key-Value storage](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2.html) as a backing store for Gloo Gateway secrets.

When Gloo Gateway boots, it reads the {{< protobuf name="gloo.solo.io.Settings">}} custom resource named `default` in the `gloo-system` namespace of your Kubernetes cluster to receive the proxy configuration for the gateway. By default, this configuration directs Gloo Gateway to connect to and use Kubernetes as the secret store for your environment. If you want Gloo Gateway to read and write secrets using a HashiCorp Vault instance instead of storing secrets directly in your Kubernetes cluster, you can edit the Settings custom resource to point the gateway proxy to Vault.

{{% notice tip %}}
Want to use Vault with Gloo Gateway outside of Kubernetes instead? You can provide your settings file to Gloo Gateway inside of a configuration directory when you [run Gloo Gateway locally]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/gateway/development/docker-compose-file">}})

## Customizing the Gloo Gateway settings file

Edit the `default` settings resource so Gloo Gateway reads and writes secrets using HashiCorp Vault.

**Before you begin**: [Set up a Vault instance](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install) either in your Gloo Gateway cluster or externally. Your instance must be routable on an address that you provide to Gloo Gateway in the following steps, such as `http://vault:8200`.

1. Edit the `default` settings resource.
   ```shell script
   kubectl --namespace gloo-system edit settings default
   ```

2. Make the following changes to the resource.
   * Remove the existing `kubernetesSecretSource`, `vaultSecretSource`, or `directorySecretSource` field, which directs the gateway to use secret stores other than Vault.
   * Add the `secretOptions` section and define a Vault secret source as shown in this guide. Optionally, a Kubernetes and/or a Directory secret source can also be specified. 
     {{< notice note >}}
     If you specify both a Kubernetes and Vault secret source in your Settings resource, the Kubernetes secret is looked up first. Keep in mind that when you specify multiple secret sources, the name and namespace of each secret must be unique to avoid unanticipated behavior. 
     {{< /notice >}}
   * Add the `refreshRate` field to configure the polling rate at which we watch for changes in Vault secrets and the local filesystem of where Gloo Gateway runs.

## Writing secret objects to Vault

After configuring Vault as your secret store, be sure to write any Vault secrets by using Gloo Gateway-style YAML. You can either use the `glooctl create secret` command or manually write secrets.

### Using glooctl

To get started writing Gloo Gateway secrets for use with Vault, you can use the `glooctl create secret` command. A benefit of using `glooctl` for secret creation is that the secret is created in the path that Gloo Gateway watches, `secret/root/gloo.solo.io/v1/gloo-system/tls-secret`.

For example, you might use the following command to create a secret in Vault.
```bash
glooctl create secret tls \
    --certchain /path/to/cert.pem \
    --privatekey /path/to/key.pem
    --name tls-secret \
    --use-vault \
    --vault-address http://vault:8200/ \
    --vault-token "$VAULT_TOKEN"
```
This command creates a TLS secret with the following value:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "tls-secret",
    "namespace": "gloo-system"
  },
  "tls": {
    "certChain": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "privateKey": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
  }
}
```

You can also include the `-o json` flag in the command for JSON-formatted secrets, which can be manually stored as values in Vault.

### Manually writing secrets

Instead of using the `glooctl create secret` command to create the Vault secret and automatically store the secret key in your Vault instance, you can use your own configuration file to create the secret. Note that you must use the same YAML format for the secret so that Gloo Gateway can read the secret. For more information, see the {{< protobuf name="gloo.solo.io.Secret" display="v1.Secret API reference">}}.

If you manually write Gloo Gateway secrets, you must store them in Vault with the correct Vault key names, which adhere to the following format:

`<secret_engine_path_prefix>/<gloo_root_key>/<resource_group>/<group_version>/Secret/<resource_namespace>/<resource_name>`

For example, if you want to create a secret named `tls-secret` in the `gloo-system` namespace, store the secret file in Vault on the path `secret/root/gloo.solo.io/v1/Secret/gloo-system/tls-secret`.

| Path | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `<secret_engine_path_prefix>` | The `pathPrefix` configured in the Settings `vaultSecretSource`. Defaults to `secret`. Note that the default path for the kv secrets engine in Vault is `kv` when Vault is not run with `-dev`. |
| `<gloo_root_key>` | The `rootKey` configured in the Settings `vaultSecretSource`. Defaults to `gloo` |
| `<resource_group>` | The API group/proto package in which resources of the given type are contained. The {{< protobuf name="gloo.solo.io.Secret" display="Gloo Gateway secrets">}} custom resource has the resource group `gloo.solo.io`. |
| `<group_version>` | The API group version/go package in which resources of the given type are contained. For example, {{< protobuf name="gloo.solo.io.Secret" display="Gloo Gateway secrets">}} have the resource group version `v1`. |
| `<resource_namespace>` | The namespace in which the secret exists. This must match the `metadata.namespace` of the resource YAML. |
| `<resource_name>` | The name of the secret. This must match the `metadata.name` of the resource YAML, and should be unique for all secrets within a given namespace. |

{{% notice tip %}}
You can also use the `--dry-run` flag in the [`glooctl secret create` command](#using-glooctl) to generate your secret in a YAML file.
