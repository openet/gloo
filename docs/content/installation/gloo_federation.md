title: Gloo Gateway Federation
weight: 65
---

Gloo Gateway Federation allows users to manage the configuration for all of their Gloo Gateway instances from one place, no matter what platform they run on. In addition Gloo Gateway Federation elevates Gloo Gatewayâ€™s powerful routing features beyond the environment they live in, allowing users to create all new global routing features between different Gloo Gateway instances. Gloo Gateway Federation enables consistent configuration, service failover, unified debugging, and automated Gloo Gateway discovery across all of your Gloo Gateway instances.

Gloo Gateway Federation is installed using the `glooctl` command line tool or a Helm chart. The following document will take you through the process of performing the installation of Gloo Gateway Federation, verifying the components, and removing Gloo Gateway Federation if necessary.

## Prerequisites

Gloo Gateway Federation is an enterprise feature of Gloo Gateway. You will need at least one instance of Gloo Gateway Enterprise running on a Kubernetes cluster to follow the installation guide. Full details on setting up your Kubernetes cluster are available [here]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/platform_configuration/cluster_setup/" %}}) and installing Gloo Gateway Enterprise [here]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/enterprise/" %}}).

You should also have `glooctl` and `kubectl` installed. The `glooctl` version should be the most recent release, as the federation features were added in version 1.5. 

You also need a license key to install Gloo Gateway Federation. To request a license, [contact Sales](https://www.solo.io/company/contact/).

## Installation

Gloo Gateway Federation is installed in an admin cluster, which may or may not include Gloo Gateway instances. You can perform the installation using `glooctl` or helm. 

### Install using glooctl

The `glooctl` tool uses Helm in the background to perform the deployment of Gloo Gateway Federation. By default, the deployment will create the `gloo-system` namespace and instantiate the Gloo Gateway Federation components in that namespace.  You can override the default settings by specify the `--values` argument and providing a yaml file with the necessary values.

Gloo Gateway Federation is installed alongside Gloo Enterprise automatically. With your kubectl context set to the admin cluster, run the following command:

```
glooctl install gateway enterprise --license-key <LICENSE_KEY>
```

The `--with-gloo-fed=false` flag can be used to install only Gloo Enterprise without Gloo Gateway Federation.

Make sure to change the placeholder `<LICENSE_KEY>` to the license key you have procured for Gloo Gateway Enterprise.

The installation will create the necessary Kubernetes components for running Gloo Gateway Federation.

### Install using Helm

You can also install Gloo Gateway Federation by using Helm directly. The default values of the chart can be overridden by using the `--set` argument.

With your kubectl context set to the admin cluster, run the following commands:

```bash
# Add the gloo-fed helm repo
helm repo add gloo-fed https://storage.googleapis.com/gloo-fed-helm

# Update your repos 
helm repo update

# Install using helm
helm install -n gloo-system --create-namespace gloo-fed gloo-fed/gloo-fed --set license_key=<LICENSE_KEY>
```

Make sure to change the placeholder `<LICENSE_KEY>` to the license key you have procured for Gloo Gateway Federation.

The installation will create the necessary Kubernetes components for running Gloo Gateway Federation.

## Verification

Once the deployment is complete, you can validate the installation by checking on the status of a few components. The following command will show you the status of the deployment itself:

```
kubectl -n gloo-system rollout status deployment gloo-fed
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
deployment "gloo-fed" successfully rolled out
```

You can also view the resources in the `gloo-system` namespace by running:

```
kubectl get all -n gloo-system
```

You should see output similar to the following, with all pods running successfully.

```

```
kubectl get crds -l app=gloo-fed

Your instance of Gloo Gateway Federation has now been successfully deployed. The next step is to register clusters with Gloo Gateway Federation.

## Uninstall {#uninstall}

To uninstall Gloo Gateway Enterprise, Federation and all related components, simply run the following.

```shell
glooctl uninstall --all
```

## Next Steps

As a next step, we recommend [registering the Kubernetes clusters]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/gloo_federation/cluster_registration/" %}}) running Gloo Gateway instances with Gloo Gateway Federation. Then you can move onto creating [federated configurations]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/gloo_federation/federated_configuration/" %}}) or [service failover]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/gloo_federation/service_failover/" %}}). You can also read more about Gloo Gateway Federation in the [concepts area]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/introduction/gloo_federation/" %}}) of the docs.
