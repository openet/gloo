## Use the Support Portal {#support-portal}

### Create a Support Portal account

3. Follow the **Create password** link in that email. Check your Spam folder if you do not see it in your inbox.

### Submit a ticket

2. Log in, and ensure your phone number is added to your profile. This is an important step, as it allows our system to recognize your account when you call the Support Hotline for urgent incidents.
3. Click **Create a ticket**.
4. Fill out the form. Start by entering any email addresses that you want updates to be sent to while Solo Support works on the ticket. Add a subject related to the issue that you are reporting.
5. Add details for the issue in the **description** field. Refer to [Details to include in your support request](#ticket-details) to help Solo Support better understand your request and provide timely and accurate assistance.

## Priority levels {#priority-levels}

|Priority level|Description|
|----------------|--|
|Urgent priority**| A problem that severely impacts your use of the software in a production environment, such as loss of production data, or in which your production systems are not functioning. The situation halts your business operations, or your revenue or brand are impacted and no procedural workaround exists.|
|High priority|A problem where the production environment is operational but functionality is severely reduced. The situation is causing a high impact to portions of your business operations, or your revenue or brand are threatened and no procedural workaround exists.|
|Normal priority| A problem that involves partial, non-critical loss of use of the software in a production environment or development environment. For production environments, there is a medium-to-low impact on your business, but your business continues to function, including by using a procedural workaround. For development environments, where the situation is causing your project to no longer continue or migrate into production.|
|Low priority|A general usage question, reporting of a documentation error, or recommendation for a future product enhancement or modification. For production environments, there is low-to-no impact on your business or the performance or functionality of your system.

## Join the solo.io Slack community {#slack}

Join the [solo.io Slack community](https://soloio.slack.com) to participate in conversations with other users and ask questions to the Solo team. 

Navigate through the channels to find topics relevant to you. We recommend `#gloo`<!--, `#gloo-enterprise`, `#service-mesh-hub` for specific product conversations-->, and `#general` for general discussion.

To migrate a discussion from Slack into an email-based support ticket, you can use the `/zendesk create_ticket` macro within the channel where the conversation started. Select **Support** as the assignee to ensure your request reaches the Solo Support team. Selecting other options will delay or prevent our team from seeing your ticket. 

If the macro hasn't been added to a channel, ask a Solo team member to assist you.
