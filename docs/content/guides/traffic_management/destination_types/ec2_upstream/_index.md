description: Routing to EC2 instances as an Upstream
---

Gloo Gateway allows you to create Upstreams from groups of EC2 instances.

Before jumping into the guide, let's become familiar with the EC2 Upstream specification.

---

## Sample EC2 Upstream Config

The Upstream config below creates an Upstream that load balances to all EC2 instances that both match the filter criteria and are available to a user with the credentials provided by the secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: Upstream
metadata:
  annotations:
  name: my-ec2-upstream
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  awsEc2:
    filters:
    - key: some-key
    - kvPair:
        key: some-other-key
        value: some-value
    region: us-east-1
    publicIp: true
    secretRef:
      name: my-aws-secret
      namespace: default
    roleArn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/describe-ec2-demo
```

### Key points
- **Credentials**: each Upstream can be configured with custom credentials which will influence what instances are available for use.
  - User credentials can be passed as an Upstream-specific secret ref or through common AWS environment variables
  - A role can be optionally be included in the Upstream spec. If provided, Gloo Gateway will assume this role on behalf of the Upstream's user account prior to listing instances. This can be a convenient way to manage Upstream-specific access control
- **Filtering**: tag filters allow you to define which instances should be associated with your Upstream
  - Filters can be specified in terms of tag key or tag key-value matches
  - If multiple filters are specified, an instance must match each filter in order to be associated with the Upstream

## Setup

The steps below will take you through the process of using the EC2 plugin to create routes to EC2 instances. You will need to have the follow prerequisites complete:

* Gloo Gateway installed on a Kubernetes cluster (use the [linked guide]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/gateway/kubernetes" >}}))
* glooctl and kubectl installed locally
* Access to an AWS account where you can launch EC2 instance and configure IAM

---

## Prepare sample resources in AWS

To route to an AWS EC2 instance, you must create an EC2 instance with a sample app and provide Gloo Gateway with the appropriate AWS credentials to access the EC2 instance.

{{% notice note %}}If you already have an EC2 instance you would like to route to and the necessary credentials configured, you can skip to the next section, [Create an EC2 Upstream](#create-an-ec2-upstream).{{% /notice %}}

### Configure an EC2 instance

Create an EC2 instance with a demo app.

1. Provision an EC2 instance
   - Use an `amazon linux` image
   - Configure the security group to allow http traffic on port 80.

2. Tag your instance with the following tags
   - `gloo-id: abcde123`
   - `gloo-tag: group1`
   - `version: v1.2.3`

3. Set up your EC2 instance
   - Download a demo app: `an http response code echo app`.
   - This app responds to requests with the corresponding response code. For example, `http://[my-instance-ip]/?code=404` produces a `404` response.
   - Make the app executable.
   - Run the app in the background.

   ```bash
   wget https://mitch-solo-public.s3.amazonaws.com/echoapp2
   chmod +x echoapp2
   sudo ./echoapp2 --port 80 &
   ```

4. Verify that you can reach the app. For example, if you send a `curl` request to the app, you get back a help menu for the app.

   ```bash
   curl http://<ec2-instance-public-ip>/
   ```

5. Create AWS credentials for the EC2 instance that you provide to Gloo Gateway. You can choose from the following options:
   * [Create a secret with your AWS access and secret keys](#creds-secret). This option might be good for quick tests or staging environments. In production environments, however, you typically do not want to store these keys in a secret in the cluster. Instead, use an AWS role.
   * [Create an AWS role with the appropriate permissions](#creds-role). When you deploy your AWS environment in production, you can assing an AWS role with the appropriate permissions so that Gloo Gateway can securely route to your AWS instances.

### Create a secret with AWS credentials {#creds-secret}

Gloo Gateway needs AWS credentials to be able to find EC2 resources. As such, you can create a set of credentials that only have access to the relevant resources.

In this example, the secret you create only has access to resources with the `gloo-tag:group1` tag.

```bash
glooctl create secret aws \
  --name gloo-tag-group1 \
  --namespace default \
  --access-key [aws_secret_key_id] \
  --secret-key [aws_secret_access_key]
```

### Create a role for Gloo Gateway to assume on behalf of your Upstreams {#creds-role}

For more fine-grained control over Gloo Gateway's access to your resources and as an additional filter on your EC2 Upstream's list of available instances, create an AWS role for Gloo Gateway. This way, the credentials that Gloo Gateway uses for your Upstreams are associated with a low-access user account that assumes the specific role with only the specific permissions that Gloo Gateway needs.

When you provide a secret reference or an AWS Role ARN to your Upstream, Gloo Gateway calls the AWS API with the credentials composed from the user account associated with the secret or the provided role (via the `AssumeRole` feature).

To configure your AWS account with the relevant ARN Role:
1. Create an AWS role. In the AWS console:
   1. Navigate to **IAM > Roles**, choose **Create Role**.
   2. Follow the interactive guide to create a role.
   3. Choose **AWS account** as the type of trusted entity.
   4. Enter the 12-digit account ID of the account that has the EC2 instances that you want to route to.
2. Choose or create a policy for the role. Example of a **Policy** that allows the role to describe EC2 instances:
   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
3. Grant the Upstream's account access to the role. In the AWS console:
   1. From **IAM > Roles**, select the role that you just created.
   2. Click the **Trust relationships** tab.
   3. Note the entries under the **Trusted entities** table.
   4. Click **Edit trust relationship**.
   5. Add your user/service account's ARN to the `Principal.AWS` list, as shown in the following example. Add the ARNs of each of the user accounts that you want to allow to assume this role.

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": [
             "arn:aws:iam::[account_id]:user/[user_id]"
           ]
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

---

## Create an EC2 Upstream

Finally, make an Upstream that points to the resources that you want to route to:

```yaml
apiVersion: gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: Upstream
metadata:
  annotations:
  name: ec2-demo-upstream
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  awsEc2:
    filters:
    - key: gloo-id
    - kvPair:
        key: gloo-tag
        value: group1
    - kvPair:
        key: version
        value: v1.2.3
    region: us-east-1
    publicIp: true
    secretRef:
      name: gloo-tag-group1
      namespace: default
    roleArn: "<arn-for-the-role-you-created>"
```

- Take note of a few of the options we have set for this sample Upstream:
  - **Region**: this Upstream indicates that it reads instances from the "us-east-1" region
  - **Public IP**: this Upstream routes to the instances' public IP addresses. If not set, Gloo Gateway will default to the private IP addresses
  - **Secret Ref**: a reference to the secret associated with the AWS account that Gloo Gateway should use on behalf of the Upstream
  - **Role ARN**: a role that Gloo Gateway should assume on behalf of the Upstream when listing the set of available instances.
  - **Filters**: this Upstream uses three tag filters to indicate which instances, among those that are accessible given the Upstream's credentials, should be routed to. One of the filters only specifies that a certain tag should be present on the instance. The other two filters require that a given tag and tag value are present.


Save the spec to ``ec2-demo-upstream.yaml` and use `kubectl` to create the upstream in Kubernetes.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ec2-demo-upstream.yaml
```

### Create a route to your Upstream

Now that you have created an Upstream, you can route to it as you would with any other Upstream.

```bash
glooctl add route  \
  --path-exact /echoapp  \
  --dest-name ec2-demo-upstream \
  --prefix-rewrite /
```

Verify that the route works:

```bash
export URL=`glooctl proxy url`
curl $URL/echoapp
```

You should see the same output as when you queried the EC2 instance directly.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we created an Upstream that allows us to route traffic from our gateway to a set of EC2 instances. We created a single Upstream and associated it with a single instance. You can of course create an arbitrary number of Upstreams and associate them with an arbitrary number of instances. We reviewed how to prepare your AWS account with a sample instance, role, and policy so as to demonstrate the information Gloo Gateway needs to implement a routable EC2 Upstream.

### Next Steps

Gloo Gateway can also use AWS Lambda as an Upstream target. You can learn more in the [AWS Lambda guide]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/traffic_management/destination_types/aws_lambda/" >}}).
