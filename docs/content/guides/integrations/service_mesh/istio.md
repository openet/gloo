menuTitle: Configure your Gloo Edge gateway to run an Istio sidecar 
weight: 1
---

You can configure your Gloo Edge gateway with an Istio sidecar to secure the connection between your gateway and the services in your Istio service mesh. The sidecar in your Gloo Edge gateway uses mutual TLS (mTLS) to prove its identity to the services in the mesh and vice versa.

## Before you begin

Complete the following tasks before configuring an Istio sidecar for your Gloo Edge gateway: 

1. Create or use an existing cluster that runs Kubernetes a version supported by both [your version of Edge]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/support" >}}) and the [version of Istio you intend to install](https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/). 
2. [Install Istio in your cluster](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/). Istio versions 1.13 through 1.17 are supported in Gloo Edge 1.14. See the [support matrix]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/support" >}}) for more details.
3. Set up a service mesh for your cluster. For example, you can use [Gloo Mesh Enterprise](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-mesh-enterprise/latest/getting_started/managed_kubernetes/) to configure a service mesh that is based on Envoy and Istio, and that can span across multiple service meshes and clusters. 
4. Install [Helm version 3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) on your local machine.

## Configure the Gloo Edge gateway with an Istio sidecar

Install the Gloo Edge gateway and inject it with an Istio sidecar. 

1. Add the Gloo Edge Helm repo. 
   ```shell
   helm repo add gloo https://storage.googleapis.com/solo-public-helm
   ```
   
2. Update the repo. 
   ```shell
   helm repo update
   ```
      
3. Create a `value-overrides.yaml` file with the following content:
- To configure your gateway with an Istio sidecar, add the `istioIntegration` section and set `enableIstioSidecarOnGateway` option to `true`
- Set `disableAutoInjection` to `true` in order to ensure Gloo components are not included in the Mesh
- Set `global.istioSDS.enabled` to `true` to allow the Gateway Proxy to consume Istio certs despite not being in the Mesh 
- Specify image fields under `global.glooMtls.istioProxy.image` and `global.glooMtls.sds.image` corresponding with the version of Istio and Gloo Edge installed respectively
  - The default Istio version is 1.17.1
   ```yaml
   global:
     istioIntegration:
       enableIstioSidecarOnGateway: true
       disableAutoInjection: true
     istioSDS:
       enabled: true
     glooMtls:
       istioProxy:
         image:
           registry: docker.io/istio
           repository: proxyv2
           tag: 1.17.1
       sds:
         image:
           repository: sds
           tag: 1.14.21
   gatewayProxies:
     gatewayProxy:
       podTemplate: 
         httpPort: 8080
         httpsPort: 8443
   ```

   {{% notice note %}}
   Although the `istioProxy` values are defined in the `glooMtls` block, the values are also used to configure `istioMtls`.
   {{% /notice %}}
   
4. Install or upgrade Gloo Edge. 
   {{< tabs >}} 
   {{< tab name="Install Gloo Edge">}}

   Install Gloo Edge with the settings in the `value-overrides.yaml` file. This command creates the `gloo-system` namespace and installs the Gloo Edge components into it.
   ```shell
    helm install gloo gloo/gloo --namespace gloo-system --create-namespace -f value-overrides.yaml
   ```
   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< tab name="Upgrade Gloo Edge">}}
   Upgrade Gloo Edge with the settings in the `value-overrides.yaml` file.
   ```shell
   helm upgrade gloo gloo/gloo --namespace gloo-system -f value-overrides.yaml
   ```
   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

5. [Verify your setup]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/gateway/kubernetes/#verify-your-installation" >}}). 
   
6. Verify that your `gateway-proxy` pod now has three containers.
   ```shell
   kubectl get pods -n gloo-system
   ```
    
   Example output: 
   ```
   NAME                             READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
   discovery-6dcc8ddc58-q4zv7       1/1     Running     0          39s
   gateway-certgen-xzr7t            0/1     Completed   0          43s
   gateway-proxy-7bc5c97449-n9498   3/3     Running     0          39s
   gloo-d8cfbf86b-v59j4             1/1     Running     0          39s
   gloo-resource-rollout-hhvf9      0/1     Completed   0          38s
   ```
    
7. Describe the `gateway-proxy` pod to verify that the `istio-proxy` and `sds` containers are running.
   ```shell
   kubectl describe <gateway-pod-name> -n gloo-system
   ```

Congratulations! You have successfully configured an Istio sidecar for your Gloo Edge gateway. 

## Set up and verify the mTLS connection 

To demonstrate that you can connect to your app via mutual TLS (mTLS), you can follow these step to: 
- Install the httpbin app in your cluster
- Set up a virtual service to route incoming requests to the httpbin app
- Require strict PeerAuthentication in the Istio mesh
- Configure the relevant upstream(s) to use Istio mTLS

1. Install the httpbin app in your cluster as part of the Istio mesh. 
   ```shell
   kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/workshops/master/gloo-edge/data/httpbin.yaml
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   namespace/default labeled
   serviceaccount/httpbin created
   service/httpbin created
   deployment.apps/httpbin created
   ```

2. Create a virtual service to set up the routing rules for your httpbin app. In the following example, you instruct the Gloo Edge gateway to route incoming requests on the `/productpage` path to be routed to the `productpage` service in your cluster. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
   kind: VirtualService
   metadata:
     name: vs
     namespace: gloo-system
   spec:
     virtualHost:
       domains:
       - 'www.example.com'
       routes:
       - matchers:
         - prefix: /
         routeAction:
           single:
             upstream:
               name: default-httpbin-8000
               namespace: gloo-system
   EOF
   ```
   
3. Test access to httpbin by sending a request to the `/headers` endpoint. This endpoint returns a response with all of the request headers received by httpbin. 
   ```shell
   curl -H "Host: www.example.com" $(glooctl proxy url)/headers
   ```
   A response indicates that httpbin is reachable. However, traffic to the product page upstream is not encrypted with mTLS.
   We can tell this because the `X-Forwarded-Client-Cert` header is not present.
   ```json
   {
     "headers": {
       "Accept": "*/*",
       "Host": "httpbin.default",
       "User-Agent": "curl/7.88.1",
       "X-B3-Sampled": "0",
       "X-B3-Spanid": "b55df4f4d6d75692",
       "X-B3-Traceid": "c048ebc0bb22b1eeb55df4f4d6d75692",
       "X-Forwarded-Host": "www.example.com"
     }
   }
   ```

4. To require all traffic in the mesh to use mTLS, apply the following STRICT PeerAuthentication policy.
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
   kind: "PeerAuthentication"
   metadata:
     name: "test"
     namespace: "istio-system"
   spec:
     mtls:
       mode: STRICT
   EOF
   ```
5. Repeat the same curl request to the product page.
   ```shell
   curl -v -H "Host: www.example.com" $(glooctl proxy url)/headers 
   ```
   The `503 Service Unavailable` response is returned because the upstream is not configured for Istio mTLS.
   ```text
   *   Trying 127.0.0.1:32000...
   * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 32000 (#0)
   > GET /headers HTTP/1.1
   > Host: www.example.com
   > User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
   > Accept: */*
   >
   < HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
   < content-length: 95
   < content-type: text/plain
   < date: Tue, 03 Oct 2023 20:15:55 GMT
   < server: envoy
   <
   * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
     upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: connection termination
   ```

6. Use `glooctl` to configure the upstream for Istio mTLS.
   ```shell
   glooctl istio enable-mtls --upstream default-httpbin-8000
   ```

7. Repeat the same curl request to the product page.
   ```shell
   curl -v -H "Host: www.example.com" $(glooctl proxy url)/headers 
   ```
   This time, the request succeeds because traffic is encrypted using mTLS. Note that httpbin received the `X-Forwarded-Client-Cert` header, indicating that Istio mTLS has occurred.

{{% notice note %}} 
If you use Gloo Mesh Enterprise for your service mesh, you can configure your Gloo Edge upstream resource to point to the Gloo Mesh `ingress-gateway`. For a request to reach the httpbin app in remote workload clusters, your virtual service must be configured to route traffic to the Gloo Mesh `east-west` gateway.
