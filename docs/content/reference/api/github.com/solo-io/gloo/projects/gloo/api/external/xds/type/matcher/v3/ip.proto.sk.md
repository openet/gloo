### IPMatcher

 
Matches a specific IP address against a set of possibly overlapping subnets using a trie.

```yaml
"rangeMatchers": []xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher.IPRangeMatcher

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `rangeMatchers` | [[]xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher.IPRangeMatcher](../ip.proto.sk/#iprangematcher) | Match IP address by CIDR ranges. |




---
### IPRangeMatcher

 
Specifies a list of IP address ranges and a match action.

```yaml
"ranges": []xds.core.v3.CidrRange
"onMatch": .xds.type.matcher.v3.Matcher.OnMatch
"exclusive": bool

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `ranges` | [[]xds.core.v3.CidrRange](../../../../core/v3/cidr.proto.sk/#cidrrange) | A non-empty set of CIDR ranges. |
| `onMatch` | [.xds.type.matcher.v3.Matcher.OnMatch](../matcher.proto.sk/#onmatch) | Match action to apply when the IP address is within one of the CIDR ranges. |
| `exclusive` | `bool` | Indicates whether this match option should be considered if there is a more specific matcher. Exclusive matchers are not selected whenever a more specific matcher exists (e.g. matcher with a longer prefix) even when the more specific matcher fails its nested match condition. Non-exclusive matchers are considered if the more specific matcher exists but its nested match condition does not entirely match. Non-exclusive matchers are selected in the order of their specificity first (longest prefix first), then the order of declaration next. For example, consider two range matchers: an exclusive matcher *X* on ``0.0.0.0/0`` and a matcher *Y* on ``192.0.0.0/2`` with a nested match condition *Z*. For the input IP ``192.168.0.1`` matcher *Y* is the most specific. If its nested match condition *Z* does not accept the input, then the less specific matcher *X* does not apply either despite the input being within the range, because matcher *X* is exclusive. The opposite is true if matcher *X* is not marked as exclusive. In that case matcher *X* always matches whenever matcher "*Y* rejects the input. |
