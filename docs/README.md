> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This information is relevant only for the Gloo Gateway (Gloo Edge API) docs that are built from this `solo-io/gloo/docs` GitHub repository and rendered on the [docs.solo.io/gloo-edge](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/) website.

## Deploying to a test site

```
make serve-site
```

## Deploying to a versioned test site

NOTE: this process should only be done from main

```
make build-docs
firebase hosting:channel:deploy $(git describe --tags) --project=solo-corp --config=docs/ci/firebase.json
```

## Building the docs

Building the docs is now done directly from the main branch, and occurs each time main is updated.
The docs are built using the `build-docs.sh` script. The script will build all relevant tags/branches of gloo
and then package them in a way which they can be deployed to firebase. The versions used are determined by the 
`active_versions.json` file.

`active_versions.json` contains 3 fields.
  1. "latest" is the name of the tag/branch which should be the default when visiting the docs. "latest" must
  be present in "versions"
  2. "versions" is the list of tags/branches which are considered up-to-date
  3. "oldVersions" is the list of supported tags/branches which are behind latest.

`build-docs.sh` clones gloo into a subdir, checks the repo out at each "version", and copies the [content](content) 
directory to a temporary location. The main branch is then checked out, and each "version" of the docs are built by 
replacing the main's content directory with content previously stored for that "version". The built docs are then
moved into `docs/ci/public/edge/<tag>`. Once each version has been built, the whole folder can
be deployed to firebase using the following command:

`firebase deploy --only hosting --project=solo-corp --config=ci/firebase.json`

Building the docs from main allows us to make changes to the way the docs are packaged and published without 
needing to backport the changes each time. This allows the build, and styles to remain consistent.


# Shortcode/Hugo tips
- Shortcodes cannot be embedded in other shortcodes
  - This means the "readfile" shortcode does not interpolate shortcodes embedded within the file
  - "Nesting" is different and allowed: you can "nest" short codes in the same manner that you can nest html tags
