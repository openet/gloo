# This file defines the profile for a user who wants to run Gloo Gateway with:
# - Edge Gateway API enabled
# - Kubernetes Gateway API disabled
#
# Since Gloo Gateway was built with the Edge Gateway API initially, there are no custom values
# required to opt-into the Edge Gateway API, and thus this file is empty
