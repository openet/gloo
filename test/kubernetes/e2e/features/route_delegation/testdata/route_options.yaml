#   - Delegate /anything/team2 to team2-root namespace
#   - RouteOptions root targeting parent route: strips 'test' header
#
# Child team1/svc1:
#   - Route /anything/team1/foo to team1/svc1
#   - No parentRefs
#   - RouteOptions team1 that should merge with parent options: forces faults
#
# Child team2-root/team2-root:
#   - Delegate /anything/team2/ to all routes team2 namespace
#   - Parent infra/root
#   - RouteOptions team2-root that should merge with parent options: prefix rewrite to /anything/rewrite
