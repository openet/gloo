# Developing Gloo Edge

Find tools and information to help you develop the Gloo Edge project.

* `contributing`: Information to help you contribute to the project, such as how to open issues, review pull requests, generate code, and backport fixes.
* `debugging`: Troubleshooting steps for debugging frequent issues.
* `testing`: Descriptions on how the tests work and how to use them.
* `tools`: A set of scripts and tools that are intended to help you develop the Gloo Edge project's codebase. Learn more about these tools in the short descriptions later in this readme.

_**Note**: For tools that help maintain an installation of Gloo Edge (the product, not the project codebase), build those tools into the [CLI](/projects/gloo/cli) instead._
