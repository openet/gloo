# Filing Issues

GitHub issues are the main way for reporting bugs and requesting features in Gloo Edge.

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please take the following approach:
1. Search for existing issues.
2. If you find a similar issue, add a comment with additional information or add a üëç reaction to indicate your agreement.
3. If there are no similar issues, [file a new one](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/new/choose)

**Issues in this repo should not contain any sensitive information. If sensitive information is critical to the issue, please reach out to Solo.io support to open a ticket.**
