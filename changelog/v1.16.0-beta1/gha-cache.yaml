    Introduce a job to run on merge to main that will cache the go modules for the main branch.
    This will ensure that there exists a go cache entry for the main branch, which future PRs can utilize.

    Update the cache to only track the mod cache and use the go.sum to determine if the cache is valid.
    Remove the existing build cache. It wasn't clear if this cache was functioning properly, and it's
    more important that we have clear cache behaviors, than CI that runs quickly but caches improperly.

    Validate that a cache hit occurs when opening a PR with no dependency changes.
    Cleanup the prep-go-runner action to not call `mod-download` on a cache hit. The impact is minimal,
    since there is nothing to download, but the syntax was wrong and needed to be fixed.
