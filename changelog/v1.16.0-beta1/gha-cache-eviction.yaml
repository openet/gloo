    description: >-
      Introduce a job that will cleanup the go modcache for PRs that have been merged.
      This follows the example defined in the GitHub docs: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#force-deleting-cache-entries
      Since cache entries are isolated to a given branch, once the PR merges, this cache entry is no longer needed.
      Leaving it around will cause the cache to grow over time and could prematurely evict other cache entries.
