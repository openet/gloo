  resolvesIssue: true
  description: >-
    Previously, header names consisting of invalid characters such as '()[]:;,<=>' were accepted when passed via the healthCheck or headerManipulation `requestHeadersToAdd` parameter. This resulted in envoy throwing an `invalid header name` error. Now, header names are validated according to RFC 9110, which is the same validation used by envoy. If a header name consisting of invalid characters is passed via the aforementioned parameters, it is caught and rejected in edge and does not propagate to envoy.
