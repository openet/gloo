      gateway2: merge multiple targetRef based Route & VirtualHost options

      Implements merging of targetRef based RouteOptions and
      VirtualHostOptions in a specific order of precedence from
      oldest to newest created resource.

      The merging uses shallow merging such that for an option
      A that is higher priority than option B, merge(A,B) merges
      the top-level options of B that have not already been set on A.
      This allows options later in the precedence chain to augment
      the existing options during a merge but not overwrite them.
