      Fix the slack reporting of nightly test results. We do this by simplifying the message that is produced
      and removing the assumption that failed tests will always produce artifacts in a particular location.
      As we expand the tests that are run on our schedule (performance, conformance, kubernetes/e2e) this 
      assumption was no longer true.
