    description: >-
      Provide a Helm field `global.securitySettings.floatingUserId` to apply floatingUserId logic, which unsets `runAsUser`
      for security contexts, for all deployments in the Gloo Helm chart. The global field will also cause templates to be rendered
      as if deployments with "enablePodSecurityContext` fields have their value set to `false` to allow for easy OpenShift deployment.
      This functionality has also been added to Gloo Gateway via the GatewayParameters resource. If `floatingUserId` is set in 
      GatewayParameters, it will be applied to all deployments in the Gloo Gateway Helm chart, unless a deployment-specific value is set.

    description: >-
      Add a new field `global.securitySettings.floatingUserId` to the Gloo Helm chart that when set to `true` has the same effect as
      setting `floatingUserId=true` for all deployment-specific `floatingUserId`s, as well as setting `discovery.deployment.enablePodSecurityContext=false` 
      and gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.podTemplate.enablePodSecurityContext=false`to allow for easy OpenShift deployment.
      The global value will override any local settings.
