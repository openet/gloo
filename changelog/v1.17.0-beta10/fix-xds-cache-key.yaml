changelog:
  - type: NON_USER_FACING
    description: >-
      Fix the node_hash implementation so that non-proxy workloads (such as ext-auth-service and rate-limit-service)
      ask for a cache key that is not prefixed with the custom proxy prefix. Without this fix, Enterprise services
      could not communicate with the Control Plane to pick up configuration.
