      gateway2: simplify how plugins handle delegated routes

      This change simplifies how plugins may perform merging
      of policies in a delegation chain, particularly in the
      case of RouteOptions. It performs an in-place merge
      such that the policy on a child route may be overridden
      by by a subsequent call to the plugin with a different
      route context.

      Further, it accurately tracks the source RouteOptions
      involved in the merge so that the statuses on them
      can be correctly reported.
