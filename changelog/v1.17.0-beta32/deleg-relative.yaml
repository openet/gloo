      gateway2/delegation: enable optional parent matcher inheritance

      In the current design, a child route must have route matchers
      that match the parent's to be considered in the delegation chain.

      There's a request to enable matcher inheritance from the parent
      such that instead of child routes needing to specify paths
      that include the parent's path as prefix, they instead inherit
      the parent prefix, headers, query params, etc. The result
      is that the paths specified by child routes are relative
      to the parent paths. Headers and query params are merged
      from the parent into the child while giving preference to
      parent matchers in case of conflicts.
