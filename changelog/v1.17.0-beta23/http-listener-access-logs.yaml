  description: >-
    Adds a new Listener level access log option.
    Previously Edge was able to configure Proxy level logging for TCP proxies and HTTPConnectionManager(hcm) level logging for HTTP.
    With this change there is a new listeneroption that will configure http listener level logs.
    While http hcm has generally more useful logs there are certain logging command operators that are not usable at certain levels.
    The old version of logging and the new version are also both configurable concurrently but will have a higher performance overhead.
    This change also introduces a new warning log for command operators that are not useful for a given levels.
    For now this warning is purely a log line to reduce thrash before hardening these checks.
