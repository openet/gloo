    description: >-
      Remove the solo-kit.json options that enable k8s code generation for the
      extauth, graphql, and gloosnapshot APIs/snapshots. This isn't needed for
      those APIs and enabling those options caused codegen to create nested
      hack/*-codegen.sh files that weren't needed.
