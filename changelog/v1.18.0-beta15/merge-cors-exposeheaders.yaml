    description: >-
      Expose `CorsPolicyMergeSettings` on `VirtualHostOptions` which allows users to specify how to reconcile CORS settings 
      when configured on both Route and VirtualHost. Specifically it is now possible to define a `UNION` merge strategy
      for the `ExposeHeaders` field, resulting in the union of the headers set at Route and VirtualHost level being
      applied to traffic for the Route.
