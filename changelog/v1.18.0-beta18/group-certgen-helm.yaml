      helm/gloo: introduce component label for grouping resources

      Introduces a `gloo.solo.io/component` label to group Helm resources
      that are associated with a given component. This is required by
      downstream projects that use Helm as a templating engine to be able
      to group resources associated with a component and customize their
      behavior. This change groups resources related required by the
      certgen component using the new label.
