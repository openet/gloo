      Previously, the controller would only watch Gateway objects for generation field
      changes which is not updated when annotations change. Since Gateway reconciliation
      should be triggered when the gateway.gloo.solo.io/gateway-parameters-name annotation
      is added, removed, or modified, the predicate was updated to check for changes in
      either the generation field or the annotations.
