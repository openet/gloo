      Fix the glooctl kube tests by ensuring that we supply a tag for the SDS image that has been built in the cluster.
      There are tests that prove the subtle behavior of our version stringer method. The solution was to
      ensure that when we supply a version for our images in CI, that we include both a label AND labelVersion.
