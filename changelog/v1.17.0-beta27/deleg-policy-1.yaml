      This change implements policy inheritance, specifically
      in the context of RouteOptions, such that a child route
      in a delegation chain may inherit RouteOptions from its
      ancestors. Parents higher in the hierarchy are given
      preference when merging the RouteOptions down the delegation
      chain, i.e. for a tree A->B->C the RouteOptions of A are
      prioritized first, then the RouteOptions of B augment that
      of A without overriding the options in A, then the options
      of C augment the merge of A and B without overriding fields.

      Additionally, it does the following:
      - Refactors the RouteOption query API to perform merging
        and prioritization within the query.
      - Translator tests for the many scenarios of policy inheritance.
      - Converts delegation translator test to a table-driven test.
      - E2e tests to verify the inheritance and merge functionality.
