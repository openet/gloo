  description: >
    Refactor `bootstrap.ValidateBootstrap()` by moving the `DisableTransformationValidation` check into the transformation plugin. This way the `bootstrap.ValidateBootstrap()` can be used in other areas independent of this setting.
    Introduce a new Validator that validates an envoy config by running it by envoy in validate mode.
