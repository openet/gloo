      This change updates the route sorting such that regex based matchers
      are prioritized over prefix based matchers to be consistent with
      Gloo gateway v1. The Gateway API states that the precedence of
      regex matches is implementation specific, so this change conforms
      to the API requirements.

      Further, it avoids prioritizing regex based matchers based on their
      lengths as this is rather abitrary. E.g., /a/b.*/.* is longer than
      /a/b./c but less specific, so it's relative order should be lower
      in the sorted order but if prioritized based on length it would
      appear before a more specific match. If there is a tie among
      regex routes, the other precedence rules govern the relative
      ordering among them.
