      gateway2: enable self-managed Gateways

      Adds capability to integrate self-managed gateways
      that are not meant to be auto-provisioned by the
      controller. This is required to support use cases
      where gateways are statically provisioned, such
      as when running the gateways external to k8s on
      VMs.

      It adds a selfManaged field to the GatewayParameters
      CRD which is used to skip the deployment of Gateway
      related objects (deployment, service, etc.). When
      a gateway is self-managed, it is expected to be
      correctly bootstrapped with an envoy config that
      matches the Gateway resource's name and namespace,
      specifically the `node` field must be configured
      correctly to link a self-managed gateway to the
      Gateway resource.
