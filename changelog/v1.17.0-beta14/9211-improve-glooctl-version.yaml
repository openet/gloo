      Fixes and improvements to glooctl version command:
      - glooctl version previously had a bug displaying the tag when a digest image is used. It would show "latest" instead of showing the actual version.
      - Both yaml and json options have been fixed to pretty the output. Previously both options did not format the display.
      - This improvement also now includes kubernetes server version information.
