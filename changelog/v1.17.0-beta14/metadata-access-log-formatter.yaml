  description: >-
    Add ability to use `%METADATA()%` command directives in envoy access log format
    config. These will eventually replace `%DYNAMIC_METADATA()%`, `%UPSTREAM_METADATA()%`,
    and `%CLUSTER_METADATA()%` as well as adding support for `ROUTE` and `LISTENER`.

    A Gloo user can now access metadata added in the route options via `envoyMetadata` 
    through this formatter.
