  description: >-
    Hardcode Envoy's reloadable feature for TE header sanitization to false. This feature as it
    exists in 1.29.2 breaks gRPC upstreams whose client library expects `TE: trailers`. This hardcode 
    will be removed when Gloo Edge depends upon 1.29.3, which has a fix for the gRPC case but is currently
    unreleased.
