    description: >-
      Clarify the inheritance behavior of CORS APIs defined on the VirtualHost and Route level. Previously,
      there was a claim that when properties were defined at both levels, they were merged. However, the accurate
      behavior is that RouteOptions fields entirely override VirtualHostOptions when RouteOptions are defined.
