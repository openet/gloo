      Add support for the [envoy.http.stateful_session.header filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/stateful_session_filter)
      This support has been added via a new HTTPListener option, `stateful_session` which can be used to configure the filter.
      Envoy notes about this filter:
      - Stateful sessions can result in imbalanced load across upstreams and allow external actors to direct requests to specific upstream hosts. Operators should carefully consider the security and reliability implications of stateful sessions before enabling this feature.
      - This extension is functional but has not had substantial production burn time, use only with this caveat.
      - This extension has an unknown security posture and should only be used in deployments where both the downstream and upstream are trusted.
