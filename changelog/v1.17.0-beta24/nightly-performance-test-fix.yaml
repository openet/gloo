    description: >-
      Ensure that the kubernetes/e2e tests are not considered for running performance tests.
      Since these are not written using Ginkgo, they will not respect the label filtering that
      performance tests expect, and therefore be executed.
      
      These tests do not run on PRs, so we skip the tests on this PR.
