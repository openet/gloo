    description: >-
      Add helm setting to define envoy runtime override for CVE-2021-29492 (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-4987-27fx-x6cf).
      By default, Envoy's behavior does not change to address this vulnerability. The desired Http Connection Manager runtime
      setting option must be defined and is exposed as the `gatewayProxies.NAME.pathWithEscapedSlashesAction` helm value.
      See https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.16.4/configuration/http/http_conn_man/runtime.html for values.
