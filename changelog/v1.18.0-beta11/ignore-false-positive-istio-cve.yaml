    description: >-
      Add istio.io/istio false positives CVEs to `.trivyignore`. These CVEs are
      from very old versions of istio for which patches have already been
      merged - these come up as false positives from trivy because we pin the
      dependencies and trivy is unable to determine that the pinned versions
      already have the fix. This is due to istio's tags not following go's
      strict semver and therefore falling back to a go pseudo version.
