  - type: NON_USER_FACING
    description: >-
      Increase the timeout for a curl request in the Gateway Kube Suite. We added retries to the curl
      in https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/pull/9335, but forgot to increase the timeout of the entire request,
      so the retries aren't being respected.
