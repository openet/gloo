      `glooctl get proxy` will not work if you have persisted Proxy CRs in etcD and you are querying
      and older server version (1.16 and below). In general, we recommend that you keep your client and 
      server versions in sync. You can verify the client/server versions you are currently running by calling `glooctl version`.
