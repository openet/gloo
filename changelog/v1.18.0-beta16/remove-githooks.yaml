    description: >-
      Remove the .githooks directory from the repository. This directory was
      used to configure pre-commit hooks for the repository, but it's sole
      use was to catch JWT tokens from being committed to the repository. This
      seems to be a bit of an overkill, and the hooks have not been maintained
      for a while.
