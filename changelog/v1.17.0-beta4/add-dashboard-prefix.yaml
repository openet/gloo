  resolvesIssue: false
  description: Introduces a new Enterprise setting `settings.observabilityOptions.grafanaIntegration.dashboardPrefix` that specifies the prefix for the title and UID of Grafana Dashboards created. It is restricted to 20 characters in length. This is useful when the data is aggregated to a central grafana instance so they do not conflict across multiple Gloo environments. Note that any dashboard created without a prefix or with a different prefix will need to be manually removed on changing this value.
