      gateway2/route-options: merge ExtensionRef override with targetRef attachment

      Implements merging of RouteOptions attached via ExtensionRef filter
      and targetRef based policy attachment. ExtensionRef based options
      have higher priority than targetRef based options, such that if
      the ExtensionRef based option sets a field, it cannot be overridden
      by a policy using targetRef. However, unset fields on a policy
      selected by ExtensionRef may be overridden by targetRef based options.

      The merging semantics is already followed when policies are merged
      along a delegation chain, so this change is required for consistency.

      The core of this change to merge policies in order of their priority
      within the query resolver itself because the resolver is responsible
      for recursively resolving the policies for delegated routes. Hence,
      existing lookup of ExtensionRef based options are moved into the
      query API that also handles the merge.
