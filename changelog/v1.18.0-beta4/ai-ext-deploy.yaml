      gateway2: enable provisioning of AI extension

      Enables the provisioning of the AI extproc extension
      via GatewayParameter. A new `aiExtension` field is added
      to enable customizing the deployment of the extension
      service as a sidecar. The extension service is opaque
      to Gloo OSS, and is left to downstream projects to implement
      and plug-in.
