      1. Add API for running postRouting transformations. This means that the transformation filter
      will be run as a part of the router filter, rather than during the standard HTTP filter chain.
      This allows access to endpoint specific information which is not available during the standard
      fiter chain.
      2. Add API for adding metadata to endpoints in static/failover upstreams. This metadata can
      then be accessed in the transformation filter mentioned above.
      3. Add new plugin type to allow adding filter in the upstream filter chain.
