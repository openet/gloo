      - Fix issue where the validation webhook did not validate on `Secret` deletions.
      - **IMPORTANT**: `Secret` deletions are now being validated. This _could_ cause a slight performance degradation when deleting Secrets. To opt-out, add `'secrets'` to `gateway.validation.webhook.skipDeleteValidationResources`.
