# Envoyinit
The running instance of Envoy. In Gloo Gateway, this is commonly referred to as the `gateway-proxy` component.

## Background
The [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) is a cloud-native, high-performance, service proxy. 

### Source Code
The Gloo Gateway service proxies provide all the functionality of the [open source Envoy Proxy](https://github.com/solo-io/envoy-gloo), in addition to some custom extensions. The source code for these proxies is maintained at [envoy-gloo](https://github.com/solo-io/envoy-gloo)

### Versioning
In the [Makefile](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/main/Makefile), the `ENVOY_GLOO_IMAGE` value defines the version of `envoy-gloo` that Gloo Gateway depends on.

Envoy publishes new minor releases [each quarter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/version_history#). Gloo attempts to follow this cadence, and increment our minor version of `envoy-gloo` as well.

## Build
*All make targets are currently defined in the [Makefile](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/main/Makefile) at the root of the repository.*

The `VERSION` env variable determines the name of the tag for the image.

You may either inject the version yourself:
```bash
VERSION=<version name> make gloo-envoy-wrapper-docker -B
```

Or rely on the auto-generated version:
```shell
make gloo-envoy-wrapper-docker -B
```

## Release
During a Gloo Gateway release, the `gloo-envoy-wrapper` image is published to the [Google Cloud Registry](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gloo-edge/GLOBAL) and the [Quay repository](https://quay.io/repository/solo-io/gloo-envoy-wrapper).

## Configuration
Envoy [configuration](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/configuration) can be provided either statically or dynamically. In Gloo Gateway, we leverage both of these patterns: at initialization time, the proxy is provided with basic boostrap configuration, and then all future updates are provided dynamically by the control-plane.

### Static
Envoy is configured with [Bootstrap configuration](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/overview/bootstrap). This provides static server configuration and configures Envoy to access dynamic configuration from the Gloo control plane.

In Gloo Gateway, Envoy configuration is processed in the following order:

1. The bootstrap configuration is defined in a [ConfigMap](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/main/install/helm/gloo/templates/9-gateway-proxy-configmap.yaml)
2. The ConfigMap is mounted as a volume on the Pod
3. At [initialization](./cmd/main.go), the container reads the configuration, and transforms it using the [Kubernetes Downward API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/#the-downward-api)
4. The transformed configuration is provided to the Envoy executable

### Dynamic
Envoy receives dynamic configuration via the [xDS protocol](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-docs/xds_protocol#xds-protocol). The Gloo [xDS](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/main/projects/gloo/pkg/xds) package contains relevant code for serving dynamic configuration.

## Debug
It can be useful to run the Envoy proxy, without the control-plane, as a way of validating proxy behavior. Please refer to [Running the Gateway Proxy locally](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/main/install/local-gateway-proxy) for further instructions.

## Testing
Tests are run using [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/).

`make test` is the entrypoint for running the unit tests in the `TEST_PKG`

To run all tests in this project:
```make
TEST_PKG=projects/envoyinit make test
```

To run a specific subset of tests, read the Ginkgo docs around [focusing tests](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#focused-specs)
```make
TEST_PKG=projects/envoyinit/pkg make test
```
